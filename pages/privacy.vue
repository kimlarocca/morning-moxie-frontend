      <p class="mb-4">
        We have implemented appropriate and reasonable technical and
        organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any
        personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and
        efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
        Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cyber criminals,
        or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our
        security and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your
        information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal
        information, transmission of personal information to and from our
        Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services within

      <p class="mb-4">
        We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
        necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
        longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax,
        accounting, or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will
        require us keeping your personal information for longer than eighteen
        (18) months past the termination of the user's account. When we have no
        ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information,
        we will either delete or anonymize such information, or, if this is not
        possible (for example, because your personal information has been stored
        in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal
        information and isolate it from any further processing until deletion is
        possible.
      </p>

        If you would at any time like to review or change the information in
        your account or terminate your account, you can: Log in to your account
        settings and update your user account. Upon your request to terminate
        your account, we will deactivate or delete your account and information
        from our active databases. However, we may retain some information in
        our files to prevent fraud, troubleshoot problems, assist with any
        investigations, enforce our legal terms and/or comply with applicable
        legal requirements.
